# Responsive-Agency-Website
-single page website
-this is my first responsive website without using css library.
-I used flex & grid in addition to media query to make this website responsive.
-I have used JavaScript a little bit in :
1.header : change the color of header after scrolling and onload .
2.on bars icon : after clicking it to make the nav lists show up , and disapear after clicking on times icon.

#please if you see the website and notice any problem on it , or on the code , i would be happy if you tell me ,
